# AFTER-THE-DRAWING

Hi, I am Arturo Ruiz and I focused on developing a prototype-plugin for the 3D modeling software Rhino. The plugin is tool that seeks to create form and space through the prominent use of projection from primitive, yet fundamental elements of design; point, line, and plane. Using these elements, in conjunction with nesting as an additional operative method, the projection process begins by providing a series of points from which the user uses as a reference-guide to create a simple, but deliberate two-dimensional schematic drawing. This drawing is then revolved and projected onto a primitive volume, predetermined by the user. Once the drawing is projected on the volume, the positive (interior) space is maintained, while the negative (exterior) space is subtracted. This process is followed by a nesting operation, and then repeated. This plugin is a tool that can initiate architectural interpretation within the design process and exploration of form and space. Creating, as Robin Evan stated, “a reality outside the drawing…[that can only] exist after the drawing, not before it” (Translations from drawing to building, 165).
